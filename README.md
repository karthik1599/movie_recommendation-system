# movie_recommendation-system

This project revolves around the development of a movie recommendation system using Python.
The main objective is to create a system that suggests movies based on user preferences and
movie content analysis. The dataset used contains various details about movies, such as titles,
genres, overviews, cast, directors, etc.
The project follows a structured process: data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA),
feature creation, text processing, similarity calculation, and system implementation. Popular
Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, and WordCloud were utilized for
data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.
